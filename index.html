            <p>The Government of Dr. Bukola Saraki in a bid to revitalize the agricultural
                 sector in Kwara State instituted the Back-to-Farm Project. This project was meant 
                 to encourage commercial agriculture in the state. The government cleared large hectares of land, procured agricultural inputs like fertilizers, herbicides and insecticides, and distributed lands to farmers. The Back-to-Farm project recorded 14 percent success, for various reasons, including 
                inadequate commercial farming experience on the part of the farmers

            <p>Nupe people have a variety of 
                celebrations in which their masquerades appear. They love celebrating the prophetâ€™s birthday (Maulud). The mask has a human body/face with a motif rising above it, placed with stylized horns. The huge masquerade wears a cloth mask decorated with cowrie shells. 

                It is used during festivals, carnivals, 
                traditional weddings, turbaning ceremonies, etc</p>

    <div>
                   <h1> <a href=""></a><mark>Historical Background of Shonga</mark></h1>

                <h3> During the Seventeenth Century Nupes came from Attagara and settled in the region of the Niger and Kaduna rivers. </h3> <br> <br>

                <h3>Tsode was the first Etsu Nupe. A party of those Nupes built Gudu on the south bank of the river Niger 
                and in course of years Gudu became a large walled town. Sometime about the middle of the eighteenth century a large party of Nupe hunters moved from Mulia to Mokwa and thence crossed the Niger and settled at Gudu.
                 Ndache Dogun was the first Hunter to cross over from Mokwa.
                 At this time they have their king at Gudu. Shortly afterwards the Nupe Etsy appears to have brought war against his subjects at Gudu and to have driven them out, breaking their town. From that day the town has remained a ruin.
                 The present town of Gudu or Ogudu as the Yorubas call it, has merely sprung up round the Niger Company since 1898. The remains of the old town wall can still be seen.
                </h3>

                <h3>On being driven from Gudu the Nupes divided into three parties and built three new towns.
                 One party built a town which they called Ndakogwenshi which was situated quite close to 
                the present town of Shonga on a hill called Pategi Gwenshi. Another party built the town of Dumegi about four miles to the south of Ndakogwenshi. 
                The third party under MallThe Etsu Nupe appears to have soon made peace with these people whom he had driven from the town of Gudu and he gave Salamu the rank of Ndakpoto. 
                Mallam Salamu became chief of all this
                 country which was known as Gudu the present districts if Shonga and Sharagi with the exception of Zambutu and he paid yearly tribute
                 to the Etsu Nupe through his Ajele named Sabo, who resided at Ndakogwenshi.
                </h3>

                <h3>Salamu was followed as Nda Kpoto in succession by Adama or Ada, Lumala, Umagi, Boiya, Baikilegbo and lbrahim. 
                These seven men were probably brothers or cousins. Some of them reigned by very short time; it is said one man reigned 16 months and another only three months.
                 The next Nda Kpoto was Amadu Tsado the son of Adama and he was followed by Amada Saba the son of Baiki Legbo.am Salam, together with Ndache Dogun and the hunters from Mokawa,

                 built a town whicIt was either during the reign of Amadu Tsado or of Amadu Saba, though probably during the reign of the former somewhere about 1800 that certain lgbonas (principally hunters) arrived in the Gudu country from Aun situated in the
                 south-east corner of Lafiaji district on the borders of the Yagba country. <br><br>

                 They had fled from Aun when the Ibadans broke their town. They built themselves a village adjoining Kpotofu-Taiyenchi, which they called Sakama. The Chief man among these lgbonas was named Awado and the other hunters saluted him as "Olupako."
                </h3>
                <h3>
                 A few years after the death in battle of Etsu Jinadu at Ragada, Jimada's Maiyaki began to collect an army from llorin to fight Etsu Majia. Idrisa, Jimada's son, 
                 arrived at llorin from the place to which he had fled on his father's death. This was somewhere about 1808 or 1809. The lgbonas at Sakama, fearing they would be attacked,
                left Sakama under Awado and built themselves a new town some seven miles away to the south-West which they called Saare, named after the stream which rises at the back of
                the town. The reason for the choice of this spot being the proximity of hills into which they could flee if attacked. Furthermore one of their members named Osojajogi, 
                a hunter, was already living there. Very shortly afterwards, probably only a few weeks, the Nupes began to desert Kpotofu-Taiyenchi for the same reason. 
                They built themselves a new town adjoining the lgbona Town and called it Sharagi. Ndadzoko was the first of the Nupes to leave Kpotofu-Taiyenchi and settle at Sharagi.
                At this time Amadu Saba was Nda Kpoto.h they called Awado, the Chief man among the lgbonas, was succeeded as their chief by his son Akinyodi. About 1833 or 1834, Usman Zaiki was recognized as Sarikin Fulani at Raba. He bestowed on Akinyodi the rank of "Olupako."
                Up to this time the chief of the lgbonas had had no rank "Olupako' had been merely his salutation. Akinyode died about 1835, and was succeeded as Olupako' by his son Dada.
                </h3>
                <h3>
                It was about this time 1834-1835, that the Emir of llorin obtained the territory now known as Shonga which included besides the small village of Shonga, the village of Ndakogwenshi,
                both of which up to then had been included in the Gudu country and under the Nda Kpoto,
                from Mallam Alihu, Emir of Gando, who had been it as a gift to Aliu, Who had been driven from the position of Emir of Lafiaji by his cousin Abdul Kadir.Kpotofu-Taiyenchi which was situated between the present town of Mangufu and Sedudengi.
                Sarikin Fulani Usman Zaiki divided the remainder of the Gudu country into two parts. Same and Sharagi he gave as a fled to Ndaturaiki,
                Amoko and Dumagi he gave as a fled to the Lakpenni. To the Ajele of the Nupe Etsu, who was then at Dumagi, he gave the rank of Pafien and made him the headman of the town Dumagi (placed in Shonga district by the Mr. Resident Dwyer). 
                The country of Zambutu added to Shonga district in 1910, situated to the West of the Gudu country,
                he gave as a fled to the Denu. Ajeles placed by the fief-holders at these three towns.
